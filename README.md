METU NCC CNG 242 Practical Assignments and Quizzes

### Midterm 1:
- static/dynamic binding (this is actually known as **dynamic scoping** if you want to search)
- normal order / eager / lazy evaluation (learn lazy eval from your **hoca**)
- copy semantics
- variable lifetime
- environment (hiding etc.)
- the first topics!! (enum, the cardinality of the set, primitive-composite)
- haskell (given some functions, they want you to find the outputs)

*there was no question about static/dynamic type checking, type equivalence, expression-command, abstraction.*

*still, it does not mean that you do not need to study and learn them.*

*we are here to **learn**, not just to pass the course.*


### Quiz 1 - Haskell
probably there will be 3 questions.

- the first and second are about doing the basic things, like reversing or doing some calculations.
- the third one is more about real life. you need to know how to define a data type.


### Quiz 2 - C++
- they did not ask the big three (copy c., operator=, destructor).

### Quiz 3 - C++
- they did ask `the big three` (copy c., operator=, destructor), `subclasses`, and `virtual`.
- they did not ask, but learn `static members` too.

### Quiz 4 - Prolog
three questions
- basic mathematical functions like `if X > 5, return X^7`, `if X < 0, return X^2`, `otherwise return 3` (used random numbers here).
- implement the geometric sequence, where the 1st element is `a`, 2nd is `a*r`, 3rd is `a*r*r`.
- there are two tables, and they are connected with an `Id`. write functions by connecting those tables with a common `Id`.

### Practical Assignment 1 - Haskell
- it was hard, do not use gpt.
- try to solve your problem by dividing the main problem into smaller problems.
- think recursively.
- do not try a `big bang`.

### Practical Assignment 2 - C++
- learn how to use `virtual`.
- for each class, check your `big three`.
- do not hesitate to `add some helper functions` to reach subclasses since you will not be allowed to use dynamic casting.


### Practical Assignment 3 - C++
- think in object-oriented way.
- do not ever try a big bang.
- use `vectors` and `strings` libraries. it is C++, not C anymore.
- search what the `clone` function does in Java, and C++ equivalence. it will help in the big three.
