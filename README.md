# CNG242
METU NCC CNG 242 Practical Assignments and Quizzes

### Midterm 1:
- static/dynamic binding (this is actually known as **dynamic scoping** if you want to search)
- evaluations
- copy semantics
- variable lifetime
- environment (hiding etc.)
- the first topics!! (enum, the cardinality of the set, primitive-composite)
- haskell

*there was no question about static/dynamic type checking, type equivalence, expression-command, abstraction.*

*still, it does not mean that you do not need to study and learn them.*



### Quiz 1 - Haskell
three questions:

- the first and second are so basic
- the third one is about defining a data type


### Quiz 2 - C++
- they did not ask the big three

### Quiz 3 - C++
- they did ask for `the big three`, `subclasses`, and `virtual`
- learn `static members` too

### Quiz 4 - Prolog
three questions:
- basic mathematical functions
- geometric sequence
- there are two tables, and they are connected with an `Id`. write functions by connecting those tables with a common `Id`

### Practical Assignment 1 - Haskell
- try to solve your problem by dividing the main problem into smaller problems

### Practical Assignment 2 - C++
- learn how to use `virtual`
- for each class, check your `big three`


### Practical Assignment 3 - C++
- use `vectors` and `strings` libraries
- it is C++ now, not C
- learn what the `clone` function does in Java, and C++ equivalence
