METU NCC CNG 242 Practical Assignments and Quizzes

### Midterm 1:
- static/dynamic binding (this is actually known as **dynamic scoping** when you want to search)
- normal order / eager / lazy evaluation (learn lazy eval from your **hoca**, in slides or internet, you cannot find how it works)
- copy semantics
- variable lifetime
- environment (hiding etc.)
- the first topics!! (enum, the cardinality of the set, primitive-composite)
- haskell (given some functions, they want you to find the outputs)

there was no question about static/dynamic type checking, type equivalence, expression-command, abstraction.

still, it does not mean that you do not need to study and learn them.

we are here to learn, not just to pass the course.
